# Maintainer Wave Playbook

This document defines how Soroban CrashLab is operated during Drips Wave cycles.

## 🌊 Wave 4 Specific Context
- **Contributor Limit**: Each contributor can resolve a maximum of **4 issues** across this entire org (down from 7 last wave). Keep an eye on assigning too many issues to a single applicant.
- **Application Rejections**: Explicitly and quickly **reject** applicants who are not a fit or if we are waiting for a specific profile. Do not leave them pending; rejecting them immediately returns their application quota.
- **24-Hour Review SLA Alert**: AI point appeals explicitly drop in when maintainers are unresponsive for >24 hours. Given our strict "Definition of Done", we risk automated points bypassing our review if we dawdle. Review inside 24h!

## Issue triage board queries

Use the following saved search queries to filter the issue board during triage.

### Pending review

Issues with open PRs awaiting maintainer review:

```
is:open is:issue label:wave4 linked:pr
```

### Stale

Issues assigned but with no activity in the last 3 days:

```
is:open is:issue label:wave4 assignee:* updated:<YYYY-MM-DD>
```

Replace `<YYYY-MM-DD>` with a date 3 days before today. For example, if today is 2026-03-25, use `updated:<2026-03-22`.

### Blocked

Issues explicitly marked as blocked on dependencies or external factors:

```
is:open is:issue label:wave4 label:blocked
```

If the `blocked` label does not exist, create it with color `d93f0b` and description "Blocked on dependency or external factor".

## Backlog freshness review (recurring)

Purpose: retire stale work items and refine active scope so the Wave board stays curated and achievable.

| Element | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Cadence** | Automated report weekly **Monday 09:00 UTC** (`.github/workflows/backlog-freshness.yml`). Maintainers complete human triage within **two business days** of each run (or the same day if the report is non-empty). |
| **Owner** | **Triage maintainer** runs the checklist and applies labels or closures. **Wave lead** steps in if backlog drift spans more than one cycle without action. |
| **Stale criteria** | See below; thresholds match `scripts/backlog-freshness-review.sh` (override via env vars documented in that script). |

**Stale criteria (operational)**

1. **Assigned `wave4` issues** — Has assignee and `updatedAt` before **00:00 UTC** on the calendar day **N days ago**, where **N = 3** (`ASSIGNED_STALE_DAYS`). Aligns with the triage “Stale” board query. Ping the contributor, then follow the Contributor SLA targets table if there is no response.
2. **Unassigned `wave4` issues** — No assignee and last update older than **14 days** (`UNASSIGNED_STALE_DAYS`). Re-scope, split into smaller issues, close as not planned with a short note, or re-label so the backlog does not accumulate abandoned scope.
3. **`wave4` + `stale` still open** — Last update older than **7 days** (`STALE_LABEL_QUIET_DAYS`) while the `stale` label remains. Un-assign and return the issue to the pool per the escalation path in Contributor SLA targets, unless a maintainer has posted a documented exception.
4. **Duplicates / out of scope** — Maintainer discretion during the same review window; close with a pointer to the canonical issue when applicable.

**Checklist each cycle**

1. Open the latest **Backlog freshness review** workflow run log, or run locally: `bash scripts/backlog-freshness-review.sh` (requires `gh` auth).
2. Cross-check with the saved queries under [Issue triage board queries](#issue-triage-board-queries).
3. Apply label changes, assignments, closures, or follow-ups; keep changes scoped to Wave backlog hygiene.

## Pre-wave checklist

1. Validate that each candidate issue has scope, acceptance criteria, and complexity.
2. Ensure issue labels are consistent:
   - `wave4`
   - `complexity:trivial|medium|high`
   - area labels such as `area:fuzzer`, `area:web`, `area:dx`
3. Confirm issue dependencies are explicit.
4. Keep an adequately sized open issue backlog ready for the new 4-issue org limit (i.e. more issues require spreading out to higher volume of distinct contributors).

## Assignment policy

- Prioritize first-time contributors on trivial and medium issues.
- **Do not** assign more than 4 issues historically to the same contributor across the org.
- Reject misaligned applications quickly using the Wave UI so contributors can reapply elsewhere.
- If no progress update is posted in 24 hours, request a status check and un-assign if unresponsive.

## Conflict-of-interest handling

Use the [Security Policy conflict-of-interest control path](.github/SECURITY.md#maintainer-conflicts-of-interest) for issue assignment, PR review, merge, severity, disclosure, bounty, and point-award decisions.

A maintainer is conflicted when they are the reporter, issue author, assignee, PR author, employer, client, sponsor, close collaborator, direct financial beneficiary, direct competitor, or prior private implementer for the work being decided.

### Required path

1. Disclose the conflict before acting. Use a public issue or PR comment for normal Wave work, and the private vulnerability report or maintainer channel for security-sensitive reports.
2. Recuse from assignment, review approval, merge, severity, disclosure timing, closure, and resolution-credit decisions for the affected item.
3. Reassign ownership to an unconflicted maintainer. For issue assignment and PR review, keep the existing Wave timers: replacement owner within **24 hours**, escalation at **36 hours**.
4. For vulnerability reports, keep the `.github/SECURITY.md` disclosure timers: acknowledgement within **48 hours**, initial triage within **5 business days**, and fix or mitigation plan within **14 days**.
5. If no unconflicted maintainer is available before the timer, the Wave lead posts the blocker, leaves the item unapproved, and opens a follow-up staffing/escalation issue instead of forcing a conflicted approval.

Known boundary: this process relies on self-disclosure and contributor/reviewer escalation for relationships that automation cannot detect. The automated policy test verifies the documented control path, timelines, and handle-based self-assignment/self-review edge cases only.

## PR review policy

Review inside 24 hours to prevent unnecessary automated appeals. Review in this order:

1. Correctness and safety
2. Adherence to the strict "Definition of Done" provided in the issue
3. Deterministic reproducibility of behavior
4. Test coverage
5. Clarity and maintainability

## Secret scanning expectation for reviews

Use the [Security Policy pre-commit secret scanning path](.github/SECURITY.md#pre-commit-secret-scanning-expectations) when a PR touches config files, environment examples, logs, fixtures, copied command output, or any material that could contain credentials.

### Review requirements

1. Confirm the contributor ran at least one recommended scanner (`gitleaks` or `trufflehog`) before opening or updating the PR.
2. If a scanner finding was a false positive, confirm the PR or maintainer discussion names the scanner and file path without pasting the full matched value.
3. If a real secret was found after push, move the response into a private channel immediately and require credential rotation or revocation before normal public review continues.
4. Confirm the contributor removed any exposed value from the branch diff and local history before approving follow-up changes.

Known boundary: this repository documents secret scanning expectations but does not yet ship an enforced pre-commit hook or CI secret scanner. Reviewer follow-through is still required.

## Release management

Use [`docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`](docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md) whenever you need to
cut a tagged release. It defines:

- how to choose the next version
- how to update [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)
- how to review backward compatibility before tagging
- which validation commands to run before publishing release notes

## Unblocking contributor failures

When a contributor is blocked on local setup, build, test, or replay issues,
point them to the
[`CONTRIBUTING.md` debugging playbook](CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-debugging-playbook)
before asking for a broad rewrite or a large debug dump.

Ask them to paste:

```bash
git status --short
node -v
npm -v
rustc -V
cargo -V
```

Plus the exact failing command and the first relevant error block. This keeps
triage focused on environment drift, dependency install problems, and replay
environment mismatches instead of guesswork.

## Security Policy

The project's coordinated vulnerability disclosure process and response expectations are defined in [`.github/SECURITY.md`](.github/SECURITY.md). Maintainers are responsible for triaging incoming reports within the timelines specified there.

Conflict-of-interest handling for security reports is defined in [`.github/SECURITY.md#maintainer-conflicts-of-interest`](.github/SECURITY.md#maintainer-conflicts-of-interest). A conflicted maintainer may route a private report to an unconflicted owner, but must not decide severity, fix readiness, disclosure timing, or public credit.

## Operational Security Assumptions

### Deployment Trust Assumptions
- The fuzzer runs in an isolated CI environment with no network access to external services during execution.
- Artifact storage is configured by the operator with appropriate permissions (e.g., `0o644` for files, `0o755` for directories) to balance reproducibility and security.
- All security-critical operations (e.g., classification, signature hashing) are deterministic and do not rely on external state.

### Reviewing PRs that touch security-relevant areas
When reviewing changes to fuzz input handling:
- Ensure all new entry points that accept external seeds call `SeedSchema::validate` (or equivalent) before using the seed.
- Verify that validation errors are handled without panicking; the code should return errors or skip execution.
- Confirm that no storage paths are derived directly from untrusted seed data (payload, ID) without sanitization.

When reviewing changes to artifact storage:
- Verify that any filename generation uses either the signature hash (`compute_signature_hash`) or applies strict sanitization (remove path separators, resolve paths).
- Check that path construction uses a safe base directory and resolves the final path to prevent traversal.
- Ensure file creation sets explicit permissions (e.g., `OpenOptions::new().mode(0o644)`) rather than relying on default umask.
- Confirm that I/O errors (e.g., disk full) are handled gracefully and do not cause panics.

### Known gaps and accepted risks
- **Null-byte validation**: The payload validator does not reject null bytes (`0x00`). Contracts that treat payloads as C-style strings may misinterpret them. *Residual risk*: low to medium, depending on contract expectations. *Mitigation*: integrators may add additional checks if needed.
- **Path traversal protection**: The library does not provide built-in sanitization for filenames. If integrators derive names from untrusted data without sanitization, directory traversal is possible. *Residual risk*: high if raw payload is used in paths. *Mitigation*: always use the signature hash for filenames.
- **Automatic validation enforcement**: The library does not prevent use of an invalid `CaseSeed`. If `validate` is not called, invalid seeds may cause panics (e.g., oversized payloads). *Residual risk*: medium. *Mitigation*: code reviews must ensure validation is performed.
- **File permission management**: The library does not set permissions on artifact files. *Residual risk*: artifacts may be world-writable or overly permissive. *Mitigation*: integrators must set explicit permissions.
- **Storage exhaustion**: No built-in handling for full disk or quota errors; these propagate as I/O errors. *Residual risk*: denial of service. *Mitigation*: monitor disk space and handle errors at the storage layer.
- **CI security scanning**: The CI pipeline runs only tests and linting. There is no dependency vulnerability scanning, SAST, or fuzz input security checks. *Residual risk*: undetected vulnerabilities in dependencies or code. *Mitigation*: integrate additional security tools (e.g., `cargo audit`, `cargo clippy` with security lints) – this is a planned improvement.

### CI security checks
- **Existing checks**:
  - Rust: `cargo test --all-targets` (compilation and unit tests)
  - Web: `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`
- **Missing checks** (gaps):
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning for Rust (`cargo audit`) and npm (`npm audit`).
  - Security-focused linter rules (e.g., `cargo clippy` with `--deny=unsafe_code` or similar).
  - Fuzz input validation tests (e.g., property tests for `SeedSchema` edge cases).
  - Artifact storage permission checks (e.g., verify that generated files have expected modes).

## Resolution policy

- If work quality is acceptable but merge is blocked for external reasons, resolve per Wave guidance so contributor effort is credited.
- Move partial work to follow-up issues with clear boundaries.

## Contributor SLA targets

These timers define the maximum response and review windows for every
participant in the Wave sprint. All times are wall-clock hours from the
triggering event.

| Event | Timer | Owner | Escalation after |
|---|---|---|---|
| New application received | 24 h | Wave maintainer | Wave lead at 36 h |
| Issue assigned — first contributor update | 24 h | Assigned contributor | Un-assign + re-open at 48 h |
| PR submitted — first maintainer review | 24 h | Assigned reviewer | Any available maintainer at 36 h |
| PR review comment — contributor response | 48 h | Assigned contributor | Stale label + ping at 60 h |
| Merge-blocked PR — external dependency resolved | 24 h | Blocking maintainer | Wave lead escalation at 36 h |
| New triage issue (unlabelled, unassigned) | 48 h | Triage maintainer | Wave lead at 72 h |

> **Why 24 h for PR review?** Drips Wave automated appeals trigger when
> maintainers are unresponsive for more than 24 hours. Missing this window
> risks automated point grants that bypass our Definition of Done review.

### Escalation path

1. **At threshold** — the owner posts a status update in the issue or PR.
   No action needed from maintainers if an update is present.
2. **At escalation timer** — any wave maintainer may step in, re-assign,
   or apply the `stale` label and request a response within 12 hours.
3. **After stale label + 12 h silence** — wave lead un-assigns, re-opens
   the issue for the next contributor, and notes the outcome in the wave log.
4. **PR review >24 h (automated appeal risk)** — any available maintainer
   must review immediately regardless of original assignment. Comment
   `reviewed-by: @<handle>` to mark ownership.

### Blocked PR Escalation Path

When a PR is marked with the `blocked` label, it enters a specialized escalation path to prevent stale backlog drift.

| Milestone | Threshold | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Initial Block** | 0 h | Maintainer applies `blocked` label and comments with the specific dependency. |
| **SLA Breach** | 24 h | `scripts/check-sla.sh` flags the PR. Maintainer posts status update. |
| **Escalation** | 36 h | Wave lead review. If block persists without path to resolution, un-assign or move to backlog. |

**Communication Template (24h breach)**
> @maintainer: This PR has been blocked on dependencies for >24h. Please provide a status update or resolve the block to prevent stale backlog drift.

### Running the SLA check

Use `scripts/check-sla.sh` to surface open items past their SLA window:

```bash
# requires: gh CLI authenticated as a maintainer
bash scripts/check-sla.sh
```

The script lists open PRs with no review past 24 h and assigned issues
with no update past 48 h. It exits non-zero when breaches are found so
it can be wired into a CI schedule.

### Running the conflict policy check

Use the focused policy test when conflict handling, security-process docs, or Wave assignment/review language changes:

```bash
cd apps/web
npm run test:policy
```

The test verifies primary allowed decisions, conflict recusal behavior, handle-normalization edge cases, policy cross-links, and the documented 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, 5 business day, and 14 day timers.

## Post-resolution feedback

- Leave practical, direct feedback.
- Highlight what was done well and what should improve.
- Keep comments specific to code and collaboration behavior.
